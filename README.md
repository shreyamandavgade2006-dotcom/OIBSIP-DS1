# IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning

Introduction

The Iris Flower Classification project is a classic example of supervised machine learning applied to biological data. The goal of this project is to predict the species of an iris flower based on its morphological measurements: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

The Iris dataset, first introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in 1936, contains three species of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each species has distinct physical characteristics, making it an ideal dataset for classification tasks.

By using machine learning algorithms, the model learns patterns from historical data and can classify new iris samples accurately. This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction, making it a valuable exercise for beginners in data science and machine learning.

Project Overview

Objective:
To train a machine learning model that can classify iris flowers into one of three species based on their measurements.

Dataset:
The project uses the built-in Iris dataset from the scikit-learn library. It contains 150 samples with four features each:

Sepal Length (cm)

Sepal Width (cm)

Petal Length (cm)

Petal Width (cm)


Target Classes:

Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica


Methodology:

1. Data Loading: Load the Iris dataset directly from scikit-learn.


2. Data Exploration: Examine the features and species distribution.


3. Data Splitting: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.


4. Model Selection: Use a supervised classification algorithm, such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), to train the model.


5. Model Training: Train the model on the training data.


6. Evaluation: Evaluate the model’s accuracy using the test data.


7. Prediction: Allow user input to classify new iris flower measurements.



Technologies Used:

Python

scikit-learn

NumPy

Matplotlib (optional for visualization)
